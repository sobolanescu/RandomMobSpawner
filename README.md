## Description

RMS (Random Mob Spawner) is a Minecraft datapack that adds an exciting challenge to your gameplay! Every 10 seconds, a random mob – either aggressive or passive – will spawn near you. Whether it’s a dangerous monster or a friendly animal, you’ll never know what to expect!

This datapack was developed on Minecraft version 1.21.4.

## Features

- Mobs are randomly chosen and include both aggressive monsters (Creepers, Zombies, Skeletons) and passive animals (Cats, Rabbits, Sheep, etc.).
- Spawns occur every 10 seconds, adding variety to your Minecraft world.
- Perfect for players looking for unpredictable and adrenaline-filled gameplay.

## How to Install

**In order for the datapack to work, Allow Commands setting must be set to** `ON`**.**
